# Prediction of Ames house prices using advanced regression techniques and ML algorithms.

### Research Objective
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

### Challenges
* A lot of categorical variables that may not be useful in problem solving
* Many categorical variables are missing
* Categorical ordinal variables embedded as quantitative variables

### Methodology
* Exploratory data analysis
* Descriptive analysis

### Expected Outcome
* Prediction of houses based on various ascpects of housing
* Determination of variables that explain/justify the sale price
